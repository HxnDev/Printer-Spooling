# Printer-Spooling

There are 3 header files and 1 cpp file. 

Header files are as follows:
List.h, nodes.h, PrinterSpooler.h

The List.h and Nodes.h are used in PrinterSpooler.h which is then called in the only cpp file "Assignment2.cpp"

All the files have been commented for your ease. Furthermore you may also add further comments if you may. I have uploaded the Visual Studio project file too. You can simply run the project by running "Assignment 2.vcxproj".

#### Furthermore "user1.txt, user2.txt and user3.txt" are simply some sample test cases I created to verify my solution

For better understanding of the scenerio, refer to "Requirements.md" and "Tutorial.pdf".
